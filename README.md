# Digital_Personal_Assistant


I would like to learn to make a digital personal assistant for myself which will have a bit of AI incorporated in to it. I got some interest in it and was thinking about learning and making one according to my own need. And then may be it will be able to interact with the hardware and IoT system at my home.
